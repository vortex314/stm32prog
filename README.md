# mqtt to serial command line
this tool works together with serial2mqtt to read and display the serial output, but also to send a binary file to be flashed.

Different modes of operation :
- manual, waits for a key press (P) to send next version of binary file to dst/DEVICE-SERIAL/serial2mqtt/flash 

- all data received on src/DEVICE-SERIAL/serial2mqtt/log is just displayed on stdout.
- all mqtt published by device can also be monitored by supplying -m options. The logical device is found on src/DEVICE-SERIAL/serial2mqtt/device where the logical DEVICE will appear. 
# One key commands
- m : toggle display of mqtt messages generated by logical device
- f : send new binary image to flash into device
- q : quit the application
# Config options
- mqtt.host , option -h
- mqtt.port	, option -p
- mqtt.serialTopic, option -t 
- serial.binFile , option -b : bin file to pick up
